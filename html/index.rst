Doctype
-------
When creating pages, make sure to use a Doctype declaration. For HTML5 (recommended), this means *all* HTML files should start with::

    <!DOCTYPE html>

.. warning::
    Before the doctype declaration, no spaces, characters or other content is allowed.

.. seealso:: `Doctype <http://html5doctor.com/element-index/#doctype>`_ at [html5doctor]_.
