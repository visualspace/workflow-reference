Web development workflow reference
==================================

A collection of best practises focused at (front-end) web development: HTML,
CSS, JS and tooling. This is the workflow we use internally at
`Visualspace <http://www.visualspace.nl>`_.

You can find a rendered version of these best practises on
`Read the Docs <http://workflow-reference.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
